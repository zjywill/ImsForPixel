## Overview

**IMS for Pixel** is a rootless carrier configuration override tool for Google Pixel (and AOSP-compatible) devices. It enables VoLTE, VoNR (5G Calling), and Wi-Fi Calling on carriers that ship incomplete or locked carrier bundles — and works even on **Android 17**, which further restricts privileged telephony APIs for third-party apps.

### Inspired by Shizuku & IMS

This project draws on the ideas of two great open-source projects:

- **[Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku)** pioneered the pattern of using Android's built-in Wireless Debugging to give user apps a temporary shell permission identity — without root. *IMS for Pixel* takes that same concept and applies it in a fully self-contained way: no Shizuku app needs to be installed. The pairing, connection, and `am instrument` invocation are handled entirely within this app using the [Kadb](https://github.com/flyfishxu/Kadb) library.

- **[IMS Patch / carrier config tools](https://github.com/imsforpixel)** demonstrated which `CarrierConfigManager` keys unlock VoLTE/VoNR/VoWiFi on Pixel hardware. *IMS for Pixel* combines those config keys with the shell-permission approach above to produce a single, simple, self-contained solution.

By merging these two ideas, **IMS for Pixel** is simpler and more convenient than either approach alone:

| | Shizuku-based tools | IMS for Pixel |
|---|---|---|
| Requires Shizuku app | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Requires root | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Requires PC / ADB cable | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Works on Android 15 / 16 / 17 | ⚠️ Varies | ✅ Yes |
| Self-contained single APK | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Shows real IMS registration result | ⚠️ Varies | ✅ Yes (notification) |

                                                            │
                                                            ▼
                                                  Poll IMS registration (≤ 30 s)
                                                            │
                                                            ▼
                                                  Post result notification
```

1. The app self-connects to the device's **Wireless Debugging** port via loopback (`127.0.0.1`).
2. It launches `BrokerInstrumentation` via `am instrument`, which runs under the `shell` permission identity — the same mechanism Shizuku uses, but self-contained.
3. `BrokerInstrumentation` calls `CarrierConfigManager.overrideConfig(subId, bundle, persistent = true)` with your chosen settings, resets IMS, and polls registration for up to 30 seconds. `am instrument` restarts the app's process, so the app UI may close at this point — that is expected.
4. On completion, a **notification bar** message reports the real per-slot IMS registration result.
5. A background `ImsQueryTool` process refreshes the in-app IMS status badges every 3 seconds.
6. The app reads the live carrier config (needs the **Phone** permission) to verify the overrides are still in effect, and `ConfigWatcherReceiver` warns you after a system update wipes them.

## Quick Start

### 1. Enable Developer Options & Wireless Debugging

1. Go to **Settings → About phone** and tap **Build number** 7 times.
2. Go to **Settings → System → Developer options**.
3. Enable **Wireless debugging**.

### 2. Install the App

Download the latest APK from [Releases](../../releases) and install it, or build from source (see [Building](#building)).

### 3. Pair & Activate

1. Open **IMS for Pixel**.
2. The app auto-discovers the Wireless Debugging port via mDNS. When the pairing notification appears, enter the **6-digit pairing code** shown in the Wireless Debugging settings.
3. Configure per-slot toggles as desired (VoLTE, VoNR, VoWiFi, etc.).
4. Tap **一键激活** (One-tap Activate).
5. Wait up to ~30 seconds. A system notification confirms success with per-slot IMS registration status.

## FAQ

**Q: Does this survive a reboot?**  
A: Yes, on Android versions that provide the persistent `overrideConfig` overload (the app always uses it when available): the system saves the overrides to disk and restores them on boot. On older versions where only the non-persistent overload exists, they are lost on reboot.

**Q: When do I need to activate again?**  
A: The system deletes persisted overrides when:
- **A system update is installed** (the build fingerprint changes) — on Pixel this is usually monthly. The app shows a notification after such an update; just tap **一键激活** again.
- The platform carrier-config package is updated.
- You insert a different SIM (overrides are stored per SIM/ICCID; the original SIM keeps its overrides).
- You factory-reset the phone.

**Q: What happens if I uninstall the app?**  
A: The overrides live in the system, not in the app, so they **stay** after uninstalling. Tap **一键恢复** before uninstalling if you want carrier defaults back.

**Q: Will this break anything?**  
A: Tap **一键恢复** (One-tap Restore) at any time to clear all overrides and return to carrier defaults.

**Q: My carrier requires provisioning — will this still work?**  
A: The app sets `carrier_volte_provisioning_required_bool = false`. This works on most carriers. Carriers with server-side IMS provisioning checks may still fail independently of this app.

**Q: Dual SIM support?**  
A: Yes. Each active SIM slot is configured independently, with its own IMS badge in the UI.

**Q: Why not just use Shizuku?**  
A: Shizuku is great, but requires a separate app to be installed and running. *IMS for Pixel* is entirely self-contained — one APK, no dependencies on other apps. It uses the same underlying mechanism (Wireless Debugging + shell permission identity) but handles everything internally.

**Q: Is the Wireless Debugging port exposed to the network?**  
A: No. The ADB connection is made over `127.0.0.1` (loopback) only. Android binds the Wireless Debugging port to `localhost` and it is not accessible from the local network.

## Security & Auditability

- **No external network requests.** No telemetry, analytics, or data collection of any kind.
- **Loopback-only ADB.** Every socket connection goes to `127.0.0.1` (the device itself).
- **Three source files.** The entire app is ~1200 lines of Kotlin across three files — easy to audit end-to-end.
- **Standard APIs only.** Hidden APIs accessed via the established `HiddenApiBypass` library and Java reflection — no native code or binary blobs.
